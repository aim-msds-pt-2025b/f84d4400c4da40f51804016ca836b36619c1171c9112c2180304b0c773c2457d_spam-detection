# Spam Detection

This repository explores improving the [spam-detection](https://github.com/young-daniel/spam-detection) repository for MLOps and production workflows. 

The original repository explores contains deployment for a simple app with a model built for classifying SMS messages as spam. 

The data can be obtained from Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset), but is also released by UCI [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/228/sms+spam+collection).
